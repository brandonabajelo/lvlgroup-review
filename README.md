# Introduction

Web design is a constantly evolving space. We expect things to live in certain places, we expect elements to behave in certain ways that are instictual but not always easily describable or identifiable (i.e hover behaviors, scroll behaviors, text styling, layouts, etc). To those who study web design and/or build this stuff for a living, there are certain best practices and conventions that we have come to accept and adhere to. With that being said, design is always **subjective**. What I think may or may not look good may vastly differ from what you guys think looks good. I'm not a designer per se, generally I work hand in hand with designers and then once a design is agreed upon, I go in and actually develop the thing. But there have been lots of instances where I had to design what I was making, so I've picked up on how things should be to some extent. I'll first explain the major considerations I make when beginning a new website and then Ill dive into a review of lvlgroup.com as it exists today.

## 1. UI / UX (User interface / User experience)

- **UI**
  - Is the website visually appealing? This boils down to design, layout, color schemes, font selections, etc. For websites built with tools like Squarespace, Wix, etc, this is usually a factor of the template you choose. In my experience with such tools, it's worth spending some money on a custom template of your liking. Often times the free templates are predicable and used too often amongst the web.

- **UX**
  - Is the website intuitive to use? Can users easily find what they are looking for? If someone can't immediately understand where things live, they will navigate away from the page and never come back.

## 2. Content

- Pretty self explanatory, is the content descriptive enough to communicate your message? Is grammar good? etc. (I suck at grammar, so I won't comment on that)

### **Side Note:**

SEO (Search engine optimization) is also very important -- this is ability of your site's pages to be indexed with search engines. In the `<head />` element of the sites HTML, you need certain `<meta />`, `<title />`, `<link />` tags that describe various aspects of the page. This is how google displays the title, description, favicons of a webpage within its search results and chrome tabs. This also dictates how your page links will display when shared on social networks. I think tools like Squarespace provide this out of the box so I won't comment too much on it yet. But just for reference, I'll include an example of what this looks like below for your site.

`lvlgroup.com` ex:

# Home Page

Initial thoughts: not enough information here to really draw the attention of the user. All you get here is the name and a high level message, why should I keep scrolling down? People have no attention span, if you don't immediately grab it, it's gone forever. Hence why short form videos like tiktok and shit are all the rage. People's attention spans are like 2 seconds.

## Logo

- I like the logo, it's easy to read and has a cool design with the arrow coming out of the "V".

## Layout / Spacing

- The site is not super complex, so it shouldn't require a complex layout. I think the layout of everything is fine. I would maybe consider the size of certain elements. For ex:

### Top Navbar

- Given the size of the logo and size of the navbar menu items, the height of the white navbar is rather large. I think you could either increase the size of the content within the navbar, or reduce the height of the navbar.

### Hero Image

- I like the basketball hoop background image and text inside of it.

### Empty Space
- People get lost and uninterested in empty space. Determining the height of various elements is difficult. There's a sweet spot between having too much empty space and having too much content within the space. For me, I think there's a little bit too much empty space that forces the user to scroll. Because there isn't a ton of content on the homepage, I don't think users should have to scroll much, if at all. Once they hit your page for the first time, boom, they should see what they need to see without any interaction.

If you scroll a little bit down, this is your view. This doesn't need so much empty space.

## Color Scheme:

- Off White, orange gradient, maroon/red
  - Not in love with this color palette. To me it falls flat on the eyes and feels a little dated.
  - It has a bit of a vintage feel, which could be exactly what you're going for -- but in modern web design, I don't think vintage is the desired feel. You want the app to pop out and attract the reader's attention.


With this orange rectangle section with the basketball hoop, there's not enough contrast in the brownish section. As a general rule of thumb, you always want your font colors and background colors to have high contrast, so visibility is super high. Notice how "THE LVL GROUP" stands out a bit more since its a white font with a darkish brown/orange gradient background. While the beginning parts of "A NEW LEVEL OF REPRESENTATION" kind of fade into each other and aren't as vibrant.

## Fonts

- I like the font family you guys have selected. One thing I would think about though is how vastly different the font sizes are throughout the page. The top navbar (Home, Founding Team, Contact) is tiny, while "A NEW LEVEL OF REPRESENTATION" is extremely large. It makes sense why that should be bigger as you want to place more emphasis on that piece of text, but the difference in size is something to think about.
- Navbar links: 14px
- "THE LVL GROUP": 27px
- "A NEW LEVEL OF REPRESENTATION": 90px

Not necessarily bad, but its a very large variance. Just something to think about.

## THE LVL DISTINCTION (aka the most important part!!!)

<img width="1716" alt="Screen Shot 2023-10-17 at 9 49 20 PM" src="https://github.com/brandonabajelo/lvlgroup-review/assets/21188194/16126c95-01e5-4cbd-b3af-7bceb9e2e97a">

This sounds nice, but what does it actually mean? This piece of text is the players first entry point into what you guys do. You guys are subject matter experts here through your own experiences playing ball and dealing with agents. Give us those experiences. How do agents operate today? Why is that less than ideal? This is where I would take the time to explain, explicitly, how the industry works today and how you guys are going to disrupt it. Everyone claims to operate with respect, integrity, and all that shit. But what do you actually do differently? Be specific. As a player, I'm probably too lazy to contact you for these answers. It should be explained right here. I would even argue that this information should be visible without any scrolling as it's the most important text of the whole site.

# Founding Team

- I like this page (yall some sexy bitches). The only comment I have here overlaps with some stuff I said before. All the names are huge, and the descriptions (which is likely more important than your names, although the gordon name is important) is super tiny. People have bad eyesight, if you have to squint to read something, you won't read it.

---

# Contact Us

- This is alright too. Like above, lots of empty space that requires aimless scrolling. With the amount of content on each page, I don't think the user should have to scroll.

## Social Icons

- Im sure you are aware, but the instagram and twitter icons just lead to square space accounts, those should lead to your own instagram and twitter accounts.

---

# Final Thoughts

Recognizing that this is probably just a square space template, there's probably not a whole lot you can do about spacing and other UI elements. If you guys want to send me all the images, logos, assetc, etc, with an updated "THE LVL DISTINCTION", I'd be happy to recreate a new version of the site (obviously for free). At which point you guys can evaulate whether you like it or not and we can iterate from there. Super excited to see where this goes!
